"content":"A static method does not have access to the current object, by definition. \n\nIt is also possible to call statically any method within a class. \n\nBut when a static method calls a non-static method, an error is produced:  Non-static method x::foo() cannot be called statically.\n\nFinally, calling staticcally a non-static method still defines $this in the target method. Static is the nature of the method, not the call.",
