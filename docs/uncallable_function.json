    "content": "The function foo() cannot be called. When the code does so, nothing happens.\nThe trick is the inclusion of a call to ``yield`` (or ``yield from``) in the function. It turns the function into a generator, and calling it directly does nothing. It needs to be called with foreach() or iterator_to_array().\nThis trick applies to functions, arrow functions, closures and methods.",
