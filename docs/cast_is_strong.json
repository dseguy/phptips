    "content": "The code below yields a Fatal Error, at linting time. PHP identifies too early the cast operator ``(int)``, and fail to recognize the function call to ``var_dump()``.\nIt is possible to create a constant called ``int``, but it is not possible to put it between parenthesis, including with spaces. PHP always confuse it with the cast operator.\nLater, ``bool``, ``float``, ``string``, ``array``, ``object`` all fail to parse for the same reasons. It is also the case for ``unset``, although this operator is not supported anymore. It is also the case for ``boolean``, and ``integer``, although PHP complains about the short name of the operator.\nThis issue has been with PHP since PHP 4.",
