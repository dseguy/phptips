Depending on the situation, they may be confused one for the other: here, ``A`` is a constant, and its value is accessible for dynamic code purposes. Yet, ``A()`` cannot be used.\nThere is no syntax to call dynamically a function whose name is stored in a constant, without resorting to a call the the ``constant()`` function or a temporary variable.",
