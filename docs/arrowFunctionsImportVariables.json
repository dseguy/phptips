    "content": "Arrow functions automatically import the variables from the current context, to be used in its returned expression. It is still possible to assign a variable in such situation, by using an assignation in the return statemeent.\nYet, this does nothing, as the variable is imported by value, even when it is a reference in the first place. Hence, reading it access its value, but modifying it has no impact on the original context.\nIf the reference is important, the alternative is to use a closure, with a reference in the ``use(&$a)`` clause.",
