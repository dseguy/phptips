    "content": "The fastest way to create a ``stdClass`` object is to create an array, and then cast it to stdClass with the ``(array)`` cast operator. It is still faster even if the array is build peacemal (2 times slower).\nSetting directly properties on the stdClass object is then about 3 times slower, and creating a class extension with an adapted __construc method is then 4 times slower.\nIn the end, this is a micro optimisation.",
