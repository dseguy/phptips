    "content": "Converting an expression like ``strpos() === 0`` to use ``str_starts_with()`` is simple and direct. However, caution is needed when the comparison involves a difference rather than equality. In such cases, replacing the functions isnâ€™t a straightforward one-to-one substitution, as the logic and intent behind the original expression may change, leading to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.",
