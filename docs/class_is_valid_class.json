    "content": "PHP allows to use ``\\class`` as a class name in a type. This is also the case for interfaces, enums, traits... and it is also valid for some others keywords.\nOn the other hand, a good number of PHP keywords are forbidden, and yield an error : ``\\self`` is an invalid class name.\nOf course, once this is typed like that, it is not possible to satisfy the type specification, and such code is actually not usable.",
