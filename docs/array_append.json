    "content": "PHP allows using short assignation operators with the array append operators. This means that the code will add 2 to the array append. No error is displayed, except in the case of ``??=``, who is yield a Fatal error, with an explicit \"Cannot use [] for reading\".\nIn any case, all of those expressions make little sense : the short assignation operators shall exist on an existing value, not a new one. Here, it looks like the default value is null.",
