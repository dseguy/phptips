    "content": "When a method returns a reference, there is a ``&`` before its name, in the signature. This means that the function must return a variable, or a property, and not a literal value.\nWhen the same ``&`` is added on a generator, this now means that the yielded values are by reference. On the other hand, the returned value mat be a literal value, without generating a warning.",
