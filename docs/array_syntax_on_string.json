    "content": "PHP strings allows access to individiual characters using the array syntax: ``$string[$index]``.\nIt is also possible to modify the string with the same syntax: the index have to be integers.\nThe positive integers are offsets, starting at zero. Any missing characters between the end of the string and the requested index is set to space ``' '``. Negative index are also valid, starting from the end of the string.\nHere, ``$a[1]`` is just after the end of the string, ``$a[10]`` is well beyond the end of the string, and ``$a[-9]`` is almost back to the beginning of the string.",
