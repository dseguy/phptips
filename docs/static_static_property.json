"content":"Static can be used as a keyword to mark a property as 'static' (sic). It could also be used as a type for that same property, leading to those confusing lines below.\nIn fact, static would accept ``self``, but also ``parent`` and any children class: just like ``self``. So, ``self`` is sufficient to type properties, and there is no need for ``static static``.",
