    "content": "Inheritance forces children classes to have only methods that are compatible with the parent's methods.\nThe only exception is the constructor, which may have a totally different signature from generation to generation.\nInterfaces apply the same constraints: their methods signature must be compatible with the host class. In this case, it also applies to the constructor.\nSo, in the case a parent class implements an interface with a constructor, and this class has a child class, the child may look compatible with the interface, and yet, be invalid at the constructor level.\nAnother good reason to avoid placing constructors in interfaces.",
