    "content": "Null and booleans support the array syntax, but always return NULL as value. Since PHP 7.4, they also report a warning, as this is not good code.\nArrays also report errors when the key type is not valid, such as another array or an object.\nInterestingly, Null and boolean accept illegal keys, with a simple warning.",
