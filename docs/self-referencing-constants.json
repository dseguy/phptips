    "content": "It is not possible to define a recursive PHP class constant, although it is possible to write it. A self referencing constant may be with itself, or it may use a complex right of class definitions before failing.\nThere is a dedicated PHP error message for this situation: 'Cannot declare self-referencing constant'.\nOne fun aspect is that the is not detected at compilation time, but at execution time, when the constant is actually used.
