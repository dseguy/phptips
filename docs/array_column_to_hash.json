    "content": "array_column() is a very handy PHP native function, which extracts a index from a list of arrays, or a public property from a list of objects.\nThe third argument of array_column() is a key, which will be used to reference the value in the resulting array. It is very convenient to turn an array into a hash.\nNote that duplicate keys will be overwritten. \nAlso, there is no reciproque function for this: turn a hash into an array of arrays or objects.",
