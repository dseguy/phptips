    "content": "This code gathers several PHP hacks together. First, the naming of an anonymous class, and this time, it is renamed as ``\\array``.\n``array`` would not work, but the absolute naming make it pass.\nThen, that ``\\array`` is used as type, and it works.\nNow, there is something that looks like an array, but is actually a random object.\nThis is a bug, since other PHP native types, like ``int`` disallow usage of their absolute name.",
