    "content": "isset() works on data containers, such as variable, properties, array elements, but not on literal or constant values.\nFor literal values, it is recommended to avoid using isset, but make a comparison to ``null``, instead.\nAnd of course, the error message is the same when the code uses both solutions at the same time. This may lead to confusion: the message suggests using ``null !== (NULL !== A)``, instead of ``isset(NULL !== A)``.",
