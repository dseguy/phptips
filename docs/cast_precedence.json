    "content": "Casting has a higher precedence than multiplication (and addition). Here, the cast on the float happens first, which leads to 0. This 0 is later multiplied by 100, and that still gives 0.\nIf $c was the first operand, it would be cast first to integer, with no impact, and then multiplied: that leads to a float value, even with the cast.",
