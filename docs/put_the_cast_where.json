    "content": "Start from a string, and turn it into a negative number. It is actually as simple as adding the ``-`` sign in front of the string.\nBut that might generate a warning, upon non-numeric string. So, the safe way is to cast the string to ``(int)``, and then, take the opposite.\nNow, this is safe, but too long. In fact, this can be shortened by adding the ``(int)`` between the string and the sign, to cast first, then negate.\nAnd, of course, one may also add the noscream operator.",
