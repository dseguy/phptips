    "content": "Noscream operator @ hides errors locally, in an expression. Variadic ``...`` spreads the elements of an array.\nWhat happens when the two are mixed?\n@ works on a variable, but it will yield a NULL when the variable is undefined, which is a fatal error when used with ellipsis. So, this is legit, but also a dead end.\n@ doesn't work on operators, so it is not possible to put it before the ellipsis, without a compilation error.\nFinally, the syntax ``@...@`` would be definitely cool. Crazy, but cool. Don't use it.",
