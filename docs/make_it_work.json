    "content": "Can you make this code work?\nThe challenge is to only add more code to this snippet, not less.\nThis syntax is valid PHP code, but one may expect ``$this->code``, instead of ``$this<-code``. Now, PHP is able to parse such syntax, and it then understands it as ``$this < -code``. For this to run, we need ``code`` to be a global constant. This can be defined before the class itself, as ``const code = 2;``. Constants may use lowercase, but this is not usual nor tradition.\nThen, comparing to ``$this`` is not possible, although the left side of the operation is ``(string) $this``. One only needs to turn ``$this`` to a string, and then compare it to a number. So, we can add the magic method ``__toString()``, which returns a number in a string.\nThe final result is ``true`` or ``false``, depending on the return of ``__toString()``.\nIn the end, the private property ``$code`` is unused. It was a bait.\n4 AI were tested on this riddle: three managed to pass, one to fail. Can you?",
