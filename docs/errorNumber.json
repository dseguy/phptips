    "content": "Besides decimal numbers such as ``8.53`` or ``3.141592654``, PHP has 2 extra decimal numbers: ``INF``, for infinity. Both of them default to a eponymous string, when displayed. This might be useful.\nIt also works for ``Array``, with some error suppression, or not-too-recent PHP version. ``Object`` would generate a Fatal error, and ``Resource`` displays something that can't be reused to build another human readable word: ``Resource id #1`` (too bad...).",
