    "content": "Did you know that sorting ``f``, ``0`` and ``-f`` actually ends up with ``-f`` first, then ``0``, then ``f``. And this works with any string, including strings with duplicate initial minus signs.\nThis is the ``SORT_REGULAR``, with which PHP compares normally different pieces of data. Any string whose first character has an ASCII code lower than ``0`` will be sorted first (in PHP 8.2+) : this means characters up to ``\/``. Then any starting character beyond ``9``, aka colon ``:`` and beyond, are sorted after the ``0`` (and any digit).\nThat normal sort is used in ``ksort()`` and ``krsort()`` since PHP 8.2. This means that these functions may behave differently, when the keys string start with a ``-`` since.\nThis sort will sort string starting with ``-`` first: given the ASCII table, it also will sort strings starting with ``+`` before the ``-``. Use this feature with caution.",
