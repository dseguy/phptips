    "content": "PHP has several convenient integer format to write them in a proper way: 0x12F, 0b110101, 0o12367. This works well as part of the code\nWhen such formats are provided as a string, it may be processed with the ad hoc native functions such as hexdec(), bindec() or octdec() : they convert a number between bases, and they also accept the native PHP formats.\nFor the reverse operation, the reverse functions are also useful, with an extra header for the format.",
