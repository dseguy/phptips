    "content": "In the code here, the __invoke() makes the class ``X`` invokable : the object may be used as a function name and it will call the magic method ``__invoke``.\nThen, in the same class, there is a property ``$y``, with the type of ``X``. That property is, hence, holding an invokable object. So, may be, it is possible to call this property as a method, and invoke it?\nWell, no. This call will yield an error, ``undefined method y``. PHP doesn't use the __invoke() here, as it would conflict with an existing ``y`` method. Also, that would make a case-sensitive method, as the property ``$Y`` doesn't exists.\nTo invoke the object in the property ``y``, one has to put parenthesis around the object, so that PHP can extract the object and then, invoke it safely.",
