    "content": "A fluent interface allows the chaining of method calls. It is a bit harder to do with functions, as there is no supporting object, but it is possible.\nReturning ``__FUNCTION__`` allows the subsequent call of the same function.\nReturning a closure of itself is also possible, yet a bit more cumbersome, as ``__FUNCTION__`` is not recognized as a string for a function call.\nThanks to Andreas Heigl for the inspiration.",
