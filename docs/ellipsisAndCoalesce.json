    "content": "Ellipsis, aka ``...`` three dots, applies only to arrays and Traversable objects. It also has a lower priority than the ``??`` coalesce operator, which means that ``??`` is applied before the ``...``.\nThis way, when the variable is undefined, it is still possible to unpack it, after having given a default value.",
