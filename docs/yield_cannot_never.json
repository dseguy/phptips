    "content": "Never, as a return type, mentions that the method will never return. This means that it either calls exit(), throws an exception, or is an infinite loop.\nInfinite loop escaped my radar until I realized it is a good way to characterize the loop in an explicit way: put any explicit loop in a ``never`` method and know before hand of the implications.\nSadly, infinite loop work very well with Yield and yield from, but such methods must be typed with ``Generator``. Too bad.",
