    "content": "TIL that constant values accepts casting since PHP 8.5. It is possible to cast a value to another type when defining the global or class constant.\nThis might be most useful when a constant must be available in several flavor, rather than with literal values.\nThe only cast that is not supported is ``(object)``.",
