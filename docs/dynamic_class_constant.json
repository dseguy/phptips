    "content": "It is not allowed to create dynamically a class constant. The only way is to create a global constant, using the define() function.\nSo, when there is a need for a dynamically created constant, the trick is to assign the class constant a global constant's value, and then, create the global constant.\nOf course, it is not possible to use that class constant until the global constant has been actually created.",
