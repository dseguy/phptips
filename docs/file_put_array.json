    "content": "The second argument of file_put_contents() is typed as 'mixed'. It may be a string, which is the most common case. It may be a stream, (aka, a resource), which pours a file into a file.\n It also may be an array. PHP simply writes the elements of the array in the file, like an implode('', $array); ",
