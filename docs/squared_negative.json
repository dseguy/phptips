"content":"This is still my favorite PHP bug : literal negative value is squared, and is ... negative. In fact, the ``**`` operator has precedence over the minus operator, and the square is then executed before the negation. Hence, the negative results. It is useful to process, correctly, parentheseses, but not integers.",
