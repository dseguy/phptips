    "content": "When you know that ``2*2 = 4``, and ``2**2 = 4`` (too), and ``2.5 ** 2.5 = 9.8821176880262``, you have to ask yourself where is this 6 coming from.\nThe answer is in the precedence. Casting has higher precedence than multiplication, so cast is done first (2.5 -> 2) then multiplication. This gives the first 4.\nThen, power, ``**``, as higher precedence than casting, so the second expression gives first ``2.5 ** 2``, which is 6.25, and then, cast it again as an integer, hence 6.\nIt's a good thing that power is so little used.",
