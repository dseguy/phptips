    "content": "This is a rare occurence: that syntax is not valid in PHP 8.1, but valid before and after.\nIn PHP 7.4 and 8.0, the syntax is valid, because ``never`` was not a reserved type. PHP considered it as a class name, but since ``die`` would prevent any return, it is not actually used.\nStarting PHP 8.2, PHP recognizes the absence of return, due to the ``die``, and accepts it.\nAlso, great edge case of a closure with a (implicit) return, but typed ``never``. Actually, it doesn't work with a regular ``return``.",
