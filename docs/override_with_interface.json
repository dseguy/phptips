    "content": "The override attribute checks that a method is actually overriding a parent definition of the same method: this implies that a class must have a parent to use the Override attribute.\nThere is a special case, which is a class without a parent, though implementing an interface. The Override attribute may be used on any of the interface method, though the class has no parent.",
