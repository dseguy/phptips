    "content": "PHP offers the ``constant()`` function to reach the value of a constant, when knowing its name.\nThis also works for class constant, using the ``class::constant`` name. This is an alternative to the ``class::{$name}`` syntax, that was introduced in PHP 8.3.\nAnd the ``constant()`` call also works on enumeration cases, which are, eventually, also class constants.",
