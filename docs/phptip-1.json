"content":"PHP enforces that methods have the same signature in a parent class and in a children class. It raises a Fatal Error if not.\nUnless for constructors, where the signatures can be different.\nThis exception to the rule is for legacy purposes, as many source code have varying signatures in a class hierarchy.\nYet, modern OOP recommends to synchronize those signatures, so has to allow instantiation using the same set of arguments.",
