    "content": "A method can display a return type, and never return it actually. This happens with exceptions, errors, yield and infinite loops. May be 'never' would be a better choice, if possible.\nOn the other hand, a function returning 'void', aka returning nothing, should not have any return statement, including the hidden one at the end of the method.",
