    "content": "The magic constants give information on the context of execution of the code. ``__METHOD__`` gives the name of the method, and its related class. ``__CLASS__`` gives the name of the current class, whatever the method. And ``__FUNCTION__`` gives the name of the curent function, or, also, the name of the method, though without the name of the class.\nBasically, ``__METHOD__ === __CLASS__ .'::'. __FUNCTION__``.\nAlso, just for fun, you can also use ``__METHOD__`` in a function, and you'll get the same as ``__FUNCTION__``. The opposite, as we can see, is not true.",
