"content":"Class names and global constant names are two distinct name spaces. It is possible to use the name of a class as a constant.\nIt is also possible to instanciate a class with a constant notation: that is, by omitting the parenthesis in the new call, when no arguments are needed.\nThis allows for very confusing lines like these ones.",
