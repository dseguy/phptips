    "content": "What is happening here? Multiple things to unfold, actually.\nThe first line is a classic ``intval()`` call, which tries to convert a string (or almost anything else), into its decimal equivalent. Here, the conversion stops at ``A``, because it is not a number.\nThe second line is a less classic ``intval``: the second argument is the numeric base for conversion. Here, with ``11``, it means that the next number is ``A``, or ``a``. So, the result is ``10 + 1 * 11 = 21``.\nThe third line raise the numeric base. While ``A`` is still 10, the ``1`` is now 21, so total is ``10 + 1 * 21 = 31``. Of course, hexadecimal is supported, with the base ``16``.\nWe can raise the numeric base until the last letter, ``Z`` : the second argument maxes out at ``10 + 26 = 36``. There, the string is converted to ``1691``.\nBeyond 36, there is no more available letters in the alphabet, so PHP just silently stops.\n\nFinally, note that providing an integer to ``intval()`` has the same value returned as a result, whatever the numeric base. As a string, it is converted.",
