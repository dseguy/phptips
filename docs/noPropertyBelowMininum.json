    "content": "TIL that PHP reports attempts to go beyond the limits (upper and lower) of integer properties. Indeed, beyond these limits, the property is converted to a float, which violate the typing.\nThis error goes away by dropping the type: the property simply changes type.\nThis also means that no error is reported when doing the same on a variable.",
