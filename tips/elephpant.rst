When there is a need an elePHPant in a text, PHP always have one ready: well, an elephant, at least.

The unicode for an elephant is ``128024`` or ``0x1F418``. It canbie used directly inside a string, or with the ``mb_chr()`` function, and not with the ``chr`` function, which is only handling a single byte.
