			Catch Is Optional: In a Try Catch Finally command, only the try part is compulsory.

In a Try Catch Finally command, only the try part is compulsory. It is possible to create a try command without any catch clause: that way, exceptions are indeed not caught. The finally clause is also optional, but when it is provided, it is always executed, even if exceptions are not caught.
