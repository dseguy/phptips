Always Compatible Variadic
--------------------------

By `Sergii Shymko <https://twitter.com/SergiiShymko>`_

A variadic argument is a valid and compatible signature, for methods that overwrite other methods.

Method compatibility usually require the arguments to be the same, but with a variadic argument and also some of the arguments from the parent method, the signature is still considered compatible by PHP.
