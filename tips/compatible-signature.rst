		Compatible Signature: This piece of code shows a signature that changes with the version of PHP.

By `Christian LÃ¼ck <https://x.com/another_clue>`_

This piece of code shows a signature that changes with the version of PHP.

Indeed, in PHP 7.x, the comment starts with ``#`` and goes to the end of the line. This also covers the ``/*`` so the multi ligne comment doesn't start, and the ``__invoke`` signature is the second one.

In PHP 8.0, the attributes ``#[PHP8]`` ends with its closing square bracket, and the signature of ``__invoke`` starts. By the end of the line, a multi-line comments starts, and covers the whole second line.

In the end, this code stays unchanged between PHP versions, although it toggles different signatures.
