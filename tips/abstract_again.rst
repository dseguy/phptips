		Abstract Again: A concrete class may have an abstract child: the child class extends the parent class, and also receives the abstract option.

A concrete class may have an abstract child: the child class extends the parent class, and also receives the abstract option.

On the other hand, a concrete method, inside any kind of class, cannot be made abstract in a child. The child class can be made abstract, and new methods can be made abstract. But the existing methods cannot be turned back to abstract.
