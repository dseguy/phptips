In mathematics, there’s the famous concept known as the 'Ramanujan Summation', where the infinite sum of all positive integers surprisingly equals -1/12. In PHP, we encounter a more practical and less abstract issue called integer overflow. When working with integers near the ``PHP_INT_MAX`` limit, it's important to proceed with caution. Casting using ``(int)`` or the ``intval()`` function, as shown in the illustration, ensures correct behavior in recent PHP versions. The example demonstrates how PHP handles integer limits and type casting safely within supported boundaries.
