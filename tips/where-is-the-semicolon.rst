This code is an attribute. A attribute always expects to be followed by a structure that it will characterize. Here, without anything else to parse, the parser displays a mysterious error about a semi colon, while none is in sight.

In fact, the closing PHP tag has a built-in semi colon, to end any expression that was still open.

This is similar to another tip, that relies on echo.
