No Property In Interface
------------------------

PHP is better than me : I thought I found a way to create properties in an interface, by declaring promoted properties in a constructor. 

Someone coding the PHP engine was smarter than me : it feels so good! (BTW, who would that be?)

It's also going to save me some sanity, as I don't have to upgrade my Static Analysis Engine.
