private Is Relaxed

			private Is Relaxed: PHP has the relaxed syntax since early 7.

PHP has the relaxed syntax since early 7.0, which allows usage of PHP keywords for methods and class constant names.

``private``, ``protected`` and ``public`` were forgotten until PHP 8.2: this is now fixed, and this beauty is now possible.

As usual, use with caution.
