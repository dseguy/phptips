		try, catch, finally Are All Optional: The finally clause in a try-catch-finally is actually optional: it can be omitted.

The finally clause in a try-catch-finally is actually optional: it can be omitted.

The catch clauses in a try-catch-finally are also optional: they can be omitted.

When the catch and finally clauses are all omitted, the try clause can also be omitted safely.
