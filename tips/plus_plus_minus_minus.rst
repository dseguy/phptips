		Plus Plus Minus Minus: What does a separated list of plus and minus do to a literal.

What does a separated list of plus and minus do to a literal? They will be merged independently in the literal. Here, two negations will make a positive, so we get a plus.

Don't forget the space between the plus and minus, or it will be a post increment operator, and a different answer.
