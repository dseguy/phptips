Redefine Native Functions

		Redefine Native Functions: It is possible to redefine PHP functions or constants, or even any defined of such, by using the ``use`` command.

It is possible to redefine PHP functions or constants, or even any defined of such, by using the ``use`` command.

This feature is interesting for testing purposes: it allows the replacement of a defined function with an alternative.

It is not possible to do this twice in the same file, nor to redefine classes.
